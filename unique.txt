- Player controls:
	- W or Up Arrow : Moves player up 1 row, or resets to row 1 when at highest row
	- S or Down Arrow : Moves player down 1 row, or resets to highest row at row 1
- Enemies spawn from the right side of the screen. They are generated based on a spawn timer with a random offset. 
- Bullets are generated from the player which goes to the end of the screen.
- Bullet speed, enemy speed, enemy spawn rate, and bullet spawn rate will increase as the score increase
- Updated the ImageOpenGL::ImageOpenGL(std::string&& filePath) function because many images did not work due to not having transparency.
